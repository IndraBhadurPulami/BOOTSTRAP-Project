        <hr>
        <h2 class="logo">LOGO</h2>
        <br>
        <p>The design of the De-suung Crest is based on the traditional Bhutanese motif.  The symbol resonates with our culture and religion. The Dorji is the symbol of fearlessness and indestructibility.  The main shaft represents the institution of Monarchy, which symbolizes national unity, strength and harmony. The pinnacle of the Crest is the Raven, which symbolizes the Monarchy who is the Supreme Commander and Chief of the armed forces. The Norbu denotes wisdom.</p>
        

        <p>The De-suungs’s connection with the society is metaphorically shown by wings in five colours – representing the lay, spiritual, executive, judiciary and the legislature.</p>

        <h3>MANDATE</h3>
        <p>As per the Command of His Majesty The King, the De-suung Integrated Training Programme is instituted to be a value-based personal development program with the main objective to encourage all citizens to be active in the greater role of nation building. Through these training programmes all De-suup trainees are expected to appreciate the sense of community, harmony and cooperation as a group and as active members of society.</p>

        <p>The underlying premise of the training programme is built upon the spirit of “volunteerism” and the positive influence of ethics and values of community service, integrity and civic responsibility.</p>

        <p>It is also expected that any citizen who have undergone this training programme will actively volunteer during disaster operations, participate in charitable activities and be of service to others throughout their lives. In other words trainees of the De-suung programme as lifelong members will enhance their abilities to shoulder their own daily duties and responsibilities naturally.</p>
